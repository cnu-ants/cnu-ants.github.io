introduction: "
I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science and
Engineering at Chungnam National University. 
I received my Ph.D. and M.S. in the School of Computing at KAIST, and my B.S.
in Computer Science from Ajou University. 
Before joining CNU, I spent six months as a visiting faculty researcher at
Google.
My research interests lie primarily in enhancing static analysis techniques to
detect faults and improve the reliability of real-world software systems,
including Android applications and binaries, as well as mission-critical
software such as satellite and autonomous driving systems."
