I'm an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and
Engineering at Chungnam National University. I earned my Ph.D. and M.S in
School of Computing at KAIST, and B.S from Ajou University. After graduating
from KAIST, I worked at Google as a visiting faculty researcher for 6 months.
My research interest is static analysis for Android applications to detect bugs
and security vulnerabilities in the apps. Especially, I have researched static
analysis techniques for multilingual Android applications (e.g. Hybrid
applications, JNI applications) implemented in multiple languages.
