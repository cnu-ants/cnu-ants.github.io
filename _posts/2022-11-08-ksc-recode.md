Two papers are accepted at KSC 2022 that will be held on December 20 to 23,
2022.
The one paper, "REcode: 프로그램 분석 도구를 쉽게 적용할 수 있는 VS Code 확장
플러그인", was written by two undergraduate students 이예성 and 백소연 at
CNU, which proposes a VS code plugin that applies program analyzers easily into
the program development phase. 
The other one paper, "커널 수준 차세대 메모리 성능 에뮬레이터", is written by
master student 용예원 at CNU and Ph.D. 김창대 at ETRI, which proposes a
kernel-level emulator for next-generation memories.
Congratulations!
